# 🧠 VaultGPT — Token Fix & Upgrade to v1.2

This document logs the key fixes, upgrades, and strategic shift that transitioned VaultGPT from unstable semantic search to a deployable, intelligent vault querying system.

---

## 🛠 Rate Limit Fix History (GPT-4 Errors)

| Problem | Fix Applied |
|--------|-------------|
| ❌ GPT-4 Token Limit Exceeded (~20k) | Lowered `max_files = 3` → then `2` → then `1` |
| ❌ Still crashing at 1 file | Lowered `max_length = 1500` → then `1000` |
| ❌ Still stalling | Switched GPT model to `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` for filtering |
| ❌ Output unreadable in terminal | Used `textwrap.fill(answer, width=100)` for console clarity |

✅ These changes produced **stable results**, even for long questions like:  
“What would Alex Hormozi say I need to do to go from £0 to £1M in a year?”

---

## ✅ VaultGPT v1.2 Features (Confirmed for Build)

| Upgrade | Function |
|---------|----------|
| 🧠 GPT-4 smart batching | Pulls from multiple files, stays token-safe |
| 📝 Markdown export | Answers saved in `/VaultAnswers/` for reuse |
| 🔁 Follow-up refinement | GPT responds to “Make it actionable?”, “Summarize?”, “Refine?” |
| 🎭 Role-mode | Answer like Hormozi, Strategist, Coach, Prophet |
| 🏷️ Tag-aware querying | Pull files tagged scaling, automation, outreach, offer, etc |

✅ All answers will now be:
- Clearly structured
- Persistently saved
- Depth-customizable
- AI-mind + kingdom aligned

---

## 🔁 Recommended Execution Flow

```
User types: "What’s the best way to generate £5K/mo using my vault?"
→ GPT filters top files (gpt-3.5 or 4)
→ GPT returns .md formatted answer
→ User prompted: “Make this into steps?”, “Refine for £10K goal?”, “More aggressive?”
→ All saved in /VaultAnswers/
```

---

## 🔐 TPM Limit Workaround (Short-Term)

## 💎 GPT Efficiency Protocol

> Maximize output per token.
> Minimize GPT-4 waste.
> Build intelligently.

---

### Step 1: Use High-Value Prompts Only

| Prompt Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| 🎯 Strategy | “What’s my best path to £1M using my vault?” |
| 📦 Assets | “Create a faceless YouTube offer using my vault” |
| 🔁 Systems | “Design an outreach system from what I’ve stored” |
| 🧱 Execution | “Write scripts to automate lead delivery” |

✅ Skip casual queries  
✅ Ask what will produce deployable output

---

### Step 2: Build in Stages

Instead of:
> “Build me an AI business”

Start with:
> “Draft a 3-stage roadmap to create an AI consulting service”

Then follow up:
- “Write the outreach email for stage 1”
- “Generate 3 pricing packages for stage 2”
- “Suggest YouTube titles for stage 3”

Build → clarify → refine → execute

---

### Step 3: Leverage Logs & Memory

| Feature | Location |
|---------|----------|
| Markdown Logs | `/VaultAgentLogs/` |
| Persistent Memory | `agent_memory.json` |

✅ Copy answers to deployable tools  
✅ Chain conversations together  
✅ Use past files to boost new prompts

---

## 🔁 Deployment Loop

```
You ask: “Which offer in my vault can be sold first?”
→ GPT scans + answers
→ You say: “Write the landing page”
→ GPT outputs .md
→ You say: “Launch”
→ Mastermold job triggered
```

👑 VaultGPT+ is no longer a tool.  
It’s a strategist. A builder. A system architect.  
And it’s online.

Let’s move.
