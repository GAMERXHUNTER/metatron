## ⚠️ Build Attempt Outcome

### Error
```bash
flutter pub get
→ Expected to find project root
→ pubspec.yaml missing
```

### Root Cause
The unzipped folder lacked a valid `pubspec.yaml`.  
Folder structure was likely:
```
E:\Kadmiel\TimeMasteryApp\TimeMasteryApp\
```
Command was run from parent folder by mistake.

---

## 🛠️ Next Step

- Repackage app zip with valid structure
- Include:
  - `pubspec.yaml`
  - `lib/main.dart`
  - `android/`, `ios/`, `test/`, etc.
- Retest by navigating to correct folder and running:
```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 🔍 Functional Requirements Summary

### 🎯 Core Philosophy
> A stopwatch for life — logging, reflecting, and optimizing every moment.

---

### ⏱ Real-Time Activity Tracking
- Prompt: “What are you doing now?”
- Starts stopwatch on input
- Logs duration into persistent time blocks

---

### 🧠 AI-Powered Time Intelligence (Planned)
- Detects overruns

- Learns from past behavior
- Suggests new time allocations

---

### 📅 Calendar Integration
- All logs become time blocks
- Blocks used for future prediction
- Weekly visual summaries

---

### ✅ To-Do Task System
- Tasks in fixed order
- Actions: Start, Complete (manual), Delay, Hide
- Tasks persist across days, weeks, months
- Optional subtasks with independent timers

---

### 🔔 Prompt Engine
- Scheduled check-ins
- “Still on task?” / “Want to review your last hour?”
- Gently corrects drift with data

---

### 📊 Reports (Planned)
- Daily/Weekly summaries
- Energy mapping by task type
- Win-streaks and milestone celebrations

---

## 📦 Final Status

You’re fully set up to:
- Build, test, and deploy Android apps via Flutter
